    <h2>Information about Christmas</h2>
    <p>Christmas is a great time of year whether you celebrate it religiously or just for fun. It's a great way to get together with your family and friends and to spread joy and cheer. It brings people warmth even in the cold winter weather. The way that I celebrate Christmas is by the non-religious way and things we do are that we buy a real Christmas tree and decorate it, we have a big Christmas dinner, we sing Christmas songs and lastly but certaintly not least we do the whole gift exchange. One of my favourite parts of Christmas is singing carols and spending time with family and friends.</p>
    
    <h2>Christmas Song: Holly Jolly Christmas Lyrics</h2>
    Have a holly, jolly Christmas;<br>
It's the best time of the year<br>
I don't know if there'll be snow<br>
but have a cup of cheer<br>
Have a holly, jolly Christmas;<br>
And when you walk down the street<br>
Say Hello to friends you know<br>
and everyone you meet<br>
<br>
Oh ho<br>
the mistletoe <br>
hung where you can see;<br>
Somebody waits for you;<br>
Kiss her once for me<br>
Have a holly jolly Christmas<br>
and in case you didn't hear<br>
Oh by golly<br>
have a holly<br>
jolly Christmas this year<br>
