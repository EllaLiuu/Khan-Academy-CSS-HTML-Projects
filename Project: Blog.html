        <p>Today is the first day of semester two. We had a P.D. day before today which gave us a little break before the new semester. If I'm going to be honest, I think we deserved more than a day break after all the work we put into the exam. Despite the break I still feel really tired from the hours of studying from the previous nights. The previous semester I had science, math, foods and business. Overall, it was a decent semester, my classes were pretty good since they were most of my favourite classes and the classes that I did the best in. However, in the new semester I have french, english, history and computer science. If I'm being honest, three out of the four courses that I have are courses that I hate. Those courses are english, french and history. I have always hated language courses since I hate to write and I'm not good at it. Today is the first time ever that I have explored comupter science. My parents both have university majors in it and encouraged me to take the course. I have always thought that I was someone who was pretty good with computers so I'm looking forward to this course which could possibly direct me towards my future profession! </p>

        <p>After almost a whole week of being in computer science, I have realized that I do really enjoy the course! One of the reasons why I love it, is since we don't have to write a lot! Yes, we have mini projects on Khan Academy but it does not require you to write formaly which I love! So far my work load all together with ally my classes is not the worse. As of right now I just have a few mini assignements each night. However, it's not even been a week of class and I have already had to do two presentations, one in english and one in history. I actually really like to use Khan Academy because I think that they organized everything very nicely and it's actually really easy to use and find your assignments! If I'm being honest, I don't love GitHub as I'm a bit confused on why we are using it and it seems a little more complicated. Hopefully, my workload stays the same and that I continue to enjoy this course!

        <p>I hate school. It has only been a little more than a week of the second semester and I already know that this is going to be a hard and annoying one. Like you know, I hate languages and english and french are no exception! In english, we're reading short stories everyday and have to respond to questions almost every night, this always takes me so long to do as I keep procrasinating. For french, we have already had a quiz about grammar and a movie. The movie was okay but I really do hate grammar as sometimes there are no rules for how to write the verbs. For history, it really is one of my least favourite courses. Everyday we get so many worksheets and it's so much work. Therefore, I already know that for the tests I'm going to have to study so much content. Computer science is acually probably my favourite course as of right now! Khan Academy is still really helpful as the videos are really clear and I like how after the videos, they make you do an activity to make sure you understand. The projects are not my favourite but they're still tolerable. Until next time!
